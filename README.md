# Github Template
<!-- Short description of the project -->
This repo is a template for quick-starting new Github repos.


## About
This repo contains:

* [logo](.github/logo.png) which represents the project
* [pull request tempalte](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) for helping users creating PRs.
* [issue template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) for helping users creating new issues.
* [readme](README.md) which you should override with project-specific details.
* [license](LICENSE.md) which you should override with your project's license.

The idea is you can download and use this template as a starter for any new
repos, saving you from having to duplicate effort across projects.

## Quickstart
Download the latest version of the template, unzip it, and copy it into your
empty project directory.

```bash
wget https://github.com/clagraff/github-template/zipball/master/ -O template.zip
unzip template.zip -d $YOUR_DIR
cd $YOUR_DIR
```

## .gitignore
You will probobly want a `.gitignore` file. If you do not already
have one, checkout Github's own [gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore)
repo which has a large collection of `.gitignore` templates.

For example, downloading a Python `.gitignore` is as easy as:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/master/Python.gitignore -O .gitignore
```
